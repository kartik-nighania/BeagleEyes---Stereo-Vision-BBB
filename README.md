Stereo Vision using CMOS cameras in real time on low cost embedded boards 
using assembly code written in sub cores known as PRUs (programmable real time unit) 
for terestrial robots and aerial drones for terrain mapping and obstacle avoidance in unknown environment.


Reasearch still under refinement.. :)
